- created extjs symlink so the Ext namespace is recognized by the sencha SDK. this allows the build to succeed
- to build the compressed/minified js code (points at index-build.js):
    - sencha create jsb -a index-build.html -p app.jsb3 -v
    - sencha build -p app.jsb3 -d . -v
- once build is complete, change the js reference in index.html to point at app-all.js.
- Extjs reference in index.html should point at ext.js
